=======================

Prep Work
---------

Writing Good Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What makes code "good"?

**Read:** Shay Howe's website will be referenced a couple of times through this course. Here's the first time. Read what he has to say about writing good code.

`Writing Your Best Code <https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/>`_

**Do:** Go back into your portfolio project and look over you code. If you see any "code smell" (that's what we call bad code), clean it up a little with Shay Howe's recommendations.

CSS Selectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Practicing using selectors in CSS with this fun game. This isn't so much as an assignment as it is just a great way to practice selecting elements in CSS. Just play around with it as long as you want :) or know it is here to practice later.
