Lesson 1: Intro to Web Development
==================================

Before we start getting into the details of programming, let's try to get a bigger picture of what is going when you open a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox), enter a URL and the website loads on your screen.

Prep Work

Before coming to class, complete the activities in each of the sections below.

How the Web Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Watch:** `How the Internet Works: HTTP & HTML <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro/internet-works-intro/v/the-internet-http-and-html>`_

**Read:** `How the Web Works <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works>`_

**Do:** Draw a diagram or write a paragraph describing the what happens when you type a URL into the address bar of a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). Describe what happens beginning from when you enter the URL, up to when the web page loads on your computer. How does the Internet knows where to find the files your computer needs? What files get sent to your computer for your browser to load?

We will talk about this at the MeetUp next week so no worries if you struggle. But also be prepared to share :)

You As A Front-End Web Developer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Read:** `Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning to Code by Cecily Carver <https://medium.freecodecamp.org/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329>`_

 

**Do:** Front-end web developers do a lot of things. They leverage skills ranging from problem solving, to creativity, to persistence, to determination, to teamwork, to self motivation. 

- What do your experiences or your persona bring to the Front-end web development world?
- How will you be able to contribute to a team of diverse developers? 

Remember that even unexpected experiences could contribute to you being a great developer.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Read:** `Building Blocks of Front-end Development <https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/04/20/front-end-dev-frameworks-libraries/>`_

**Do:** Draw picture or describe how each of the 3 languages used in Front-end web development work with each other? What are each of their primary responsibilities and how to they interactive with each other? We will talk about this at the MeetUp so be prepared to share.
