Lesson 1: Installation and Git to know your computer!
-----------------------------------------------------

In-class Work
=============

Welcome to CoderGirl! Today we will be making sure that everyone has everything installed and that we are ready to go!

Before you leave class, you should have access to the following:

1. Canvas. You should already have accessed Canvas before class started, but we will show you the key things to check.
2. Slack. There are both desktop and mobile versions of the Slack app, so please choose whatever works best for you!

    .. note::
       We will be using Slack a lot during this class for a variety of purposes, including notifying the class of class changes, organizing study sessions and answering questions when you are out of class, so it is **really** important that you use Slack and check it often.

3. Visual Studio Code. Our code editor for the course.
4. Udacity. Some of the prep work for the class relies on videos on the Udacity site.

After everyone has everything installed, open up your command line tool.
