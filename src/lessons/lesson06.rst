Lesson 6: CSS Layouts
---------------------

Prep Work
=========
There are a lot of different tools to help you get gorgeous CSS layouts. Last lesson we learned about responsive design, which enables us to make our CSS respond to the screen size that the website is being displayed on.

For this lesson, we will be using CSS Grid, which has properties to make the elements of the grid responsive. Check out this `series of videos <https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE/>`_ before coming to class.

In-class Work
=============
CSS Grid is just one of many CSS layout tools and we will talk about others in class. After we talk about different tools, take some time to work on the assignment for next week. 

Assignment
==========

After all of that work on your portfolio site, it is time to add a grid of project images. Much like in the resources in the prep work, you will be creating an image grid on your ``index.html`` page that displays screenshots of your projects. For now, feel free to use screenshots of your code, terminal, or portfolio site. As you grow throughout the course and in the future, you will have many more projects to add to the image grid. Make sure to submit the link to your Github repo in Canvas when you are done!
