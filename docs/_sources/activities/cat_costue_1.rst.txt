Cat Costume Project - Part I
============================

Intro
~~~~~

Time to start a new project! The Cat Costume Project!

This Project will help you practice using HTML & CSS as well as Git.

Challenge 1: Create your File Structure and your HTML/CSS files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**STEP 1: Create Project Directory**
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory that you keep your programming project in (you should have created it when you created your portfolio project).

Create a new directory with the ``mkdir`` command called cat_costume_project.

| **STEP 2: Download Starter Files**
| We set this project up for you so you can get to practicing HTML/CSS
  part faster.

Download these project files here: `Cat Costume Project -
GitHub <https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/web_group_project_1>`__

* click the green "Clone or Download" button.
* click the "Download Zip" option.
* find that downloaded zip file on your computer.
* unzip the file by double clicking it.

Now copy and paste the contents of the ``web_group_project_1-master`` into
your ``cat_costume_project`` directory. (This is probably easier to do in
a Finder/Explorer window rather than the terminal).

Now you should have a project directory that looks like this:

::

   cat_costume_project/
       assets/
           css/
               index.css
           images/
               (all the images you will need)

       design/
           (design files)

       index.html
       README.md

Open your Project In Atom.

Challenge 2: Initialize Git Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**STEP 1: Initialize Git Repo**

Open your terminal (if not already open) and navigate to your ``cat_costume_project`` directory.

Make sure you are inside your project directory so ``cd cat_costume_project`` and when you ``ls`` you see the index.html file.

Use the ``git init`` command to initialize this project as a git repository.

Then configure your git name and email with the following commands.

::

   git config --global user.name <name>
   git config --global user.email <email>

   Initializing the directory as a git repository, allows you to use git
   version control on this project.

**STEP 2: Making Your First Commit**

Use the following commands to make your first initial commit…

::

   git add .
   git commit -m "created project structure"

That’s it! Now you are ready to code!

Challenge 3: Start Working on the HTML/CSS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take a look at the design files for this project (located in the design
folder). Pick a piece to work on and go from there. Remember to use git
along the way to keep track of changes. Below is a cheat sheet to help
you:

::

   // what changes have been made from my previous version
   git status

   // stage these changes, they are pretty good and I will probably want to commit them
   git add <file-path>

   // commit all my staged changes because I am done with a little piece
   git commit -m “this is what i changed”

   // list all of my commits
   git log

   // undo this file change because I messed up and don't want it anymore
   git checkout <file>
