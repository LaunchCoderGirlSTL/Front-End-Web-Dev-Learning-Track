Introduction
============

**Welcome to CoderGirl's Front-End Web Developer Learning Track!**

This path is for people wanting to code websites. By the end of this path you will have:

* Learned 3 Programming Languages - HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Learned a few other tools for building the Web (version control, frameworks and development tools)
* Built 2 Websites
* Started to build an Online Portfolio for Yourself

There are a couple of things that we provide to you to help you learn:

The Learning Material
---------------------

`learn.launchcode.org <https://learn.launchcode.org>`_ will act as your portal to all the resources you will need on your learning path. Here you will find all your lessons and assignments. 

The CoderGirl Meetup
------------------------

Every Wednesday we will meet 6-8 p.m. at LaunchCode Mentor Center. What we do at the meetup will change from week to week. **Make sure to bring:**
* Computer
* Computer charger
* Headphones
* A pen and paper

MeetUps will usually consist of:

**“Quick Talks”** - Mini lessons on things that are challenging or confusing when learning web development.

**Coding Demos** - Sometimes it helps to see how mentors approach problems and challenges, so there will be some coding demonstrations done by the mentors.

**Share/Discussion** - You will get to show your assignments or ask questions during class. Programming is rarely done solo and it helps to share your code and see how others tackled the same problem.

**Group Work** - Group Challenge days are some of the best days! 

**Individual Work** - Sometimes you just need time to get through the learning material. This is where mentors are really are helpful. You can flag a mentor down for individual questions or discussion.

Working On Your Own
-------------------

Outside of the CoderGirl MeetUp, you are expected to work through the learning materials. You should devote 8-12 hours each week to your work. We know life gets in the way sometimes, so we are flexible.  

When working outside of the meetup make sure to use Slack. Slack is a great tool that allows you to not feel lonely as you are learning outside of the physical CoderGirl meetup. This is where you can talk to other people in your cohort (maybe some homework help), get help from mentors, or post cool and helpful things you find as you learn. It's the same community you will find at the physical meetup but ONLINE! It's great.

If you have slack, but aren't sure how to use it, just Google it. There are some great articles out there. (You can also start with the one Slack offers.)

That's all that you need to know for now. You should now dive into the :ref:`setup`.
